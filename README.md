This mini project is called "Fizz Buzz." I will be creating a mini code for integers that are divisible by 3 will print out "fizz." For integers divisible by 5, it will print out "buzz." And for integers that are both divisible by 3 and 5, it will print out "Fizz buzz."

Pseudo code
1. when a user inputs a number into the computer...
2. loop from 1 to the number the user inputed.
3. if that number is divisible by 4 without any remainders, then have the computer print out "Fizz."
4. if that number is divisible by 6 without any remainders, then have the computer print out "Buzz."
5. if that number is divisible by 4 AND 6 without any remainders, then have the computer print out "FizzBuzz."
6. if none of the above applies to the number the user inputted, then print the current number.
7. the program will stop after the number is not divisible by any of the following conditions up to the number the user inputed.
